# Bandsintown Clone Backend

This is the backend for the Bandsintown Clone project. It provides the necessary API endpoints to search for artists, view their touring history, access setlists, and retrieve other band-related information. The backend is built with Ruby on Rails and follows a RESTful API architecture.

---

## Features

- **Search for Bands/Artists**: Allows users to search for specific bands or artists by name.
- **View Artist Information**: Returns information about the artist, such as name, genre, and bio.
- **Touring History**: Provides information about past tours, including dates and locations.
- **Setlists**: Displays the setlists for a band's previous concerts.
- **Event Listings**: Displays upcoming events and concerts for artists.

## Technologies Used

- **Ruby on Rails**: A web application framework used for building the API.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight, file-based database used for storing the appâ€™s data (you can switch to a production-grade database like PostgreSQL later).
- **RESTful API**: The backend follows RESTful principles for API endpoints.
